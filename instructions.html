        <h1>How to play:</h1><br>
        <p>DASHER is a parkour game in which the player is able to move around vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. It is able to jump to a certain height, so it's up to the player to time the jumps and movements correctly.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The goal of the game is to move from one platform to the other, ascending until the player is able to touch the platform of the same color, upon which the game will end and a screen will come up saying "YOU WIN!!!".</p>
        <br>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to control the player. Left arrow is left horizontal movement, right arrow is right horizontal movement, up arrow is jump upwards. Clicking the up arrow and one of the two directional arrows at the same time will move the character up and diagonally.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The orange base at the bottom represents lava. If the player touches lava, it will be sent back to the beginning of the level. The lava is a component that should be avoided!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Click "new game" to start over, and you can fill in the values for the background color input and the player color dropdown menu to customize the game.</p>
